                <p>The Pokémon franchise is set in a world in which humans coexist with creatures known as Pokémon.
                    Pokémon
                    Red
                    and Blue introduced 151 Pokémon species, with new Pokémon being introduced in subsequent games; as
                    of
                    February 2023, 1,015 Pokémon species have been introduced.[b] Many Pokémon are designed to resemble
                    real-world animals;[12] for example, Pikachu is a yellow mouse-like Pokémon[13] with a lightning
                    bolt-shaped
                    tail,[14] and possesses electrical abilities.[15]

                    The player character takes the role of a Pokémon Trainer. The Trainer's three primary goals are to
                    explore
                    the Pokémon world, complete their Pokédex―an electronic handheld encyclopedia―by obtaining all
                    available
                    Pokémon, and to train a team of up to six Pokémon at a time and engage them in battle. To obtain
                    most
                    Pokémon, the Trainer uses a spherical device known as a Poké Ball. Once the opposing Pokémon is
                    sufficiently
                    weakened, the Trainer throws the Poké Ball against it, and it is then transformed into a form of
                    energy
                    to
                    be transported into the device. Once the Pokémon is successfully caught, it is under the Trainer's
                    command
                    from then on. If the Poké Ball is thrown again, the Pokémon re-materializes into its original state.
                    The
                    Trainer's Pokémon can engage in battles against opposing Pokémon, including those in the wild or
                    owned
                    by
                    other Trainers. Because the franchise is aimed at children, these battles are never presented as
                    overtly
                    violent and contain no blood or gore.[c] Pokémon never die in battle, instead fainting upon being
                    defeated.[20][21][22]

                    After a Pokémon wins a battle, it gains experience and becomes stronger.[23] After gaining a certain
                    amount
                    of experience points, its level increases, as well as one or more of its statistics. As its level
                    increases,
                    the Pokémon can learn new offensive and defensive moves to use in battle.[24][25] Many species of
                    Pokémon
                    can evolve into a different species, with increased stats compared to its pre-evolved form.[26] Most
                    species
                    will evolve at a certain level, while others evolve through different means, such as exposure to a
                    certain
                    item.[27]</p>
